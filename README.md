# MTEmberApp

MTEmberApp was created using the ember.js and ember_data.js Javascript MVC client-side framework libraries as an example of rapid development for dynamic web apps. It also uses the Twitter Bootsrap CSS and Javascript libraries for the UI look and feel, as well as moment.js for date formatting, and showdown.js for HTML markdown.
